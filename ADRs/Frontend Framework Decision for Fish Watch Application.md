# Frontend Framework Decision for Fish Watch Application
## Status
ACCEPTED
## Context 
In developing the Fish Watch application, a comprehensive fish farm management system, a decision needs to be made regarding the frontend framework to be used. The frontend will serve as the primary interface for farmers to interact with the system, visualize data, and manage their farms. Considering the requirements for a responsive, modular, and maintainable frontend, we need to evaluate various options and select the most suitable framework.
## Decision
We have decided to utilize Angular as the frontend framework for the Fish Watch application.
## Rationale
* **Modularity and Component-based Architecture:** Angular's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable UI components, which aligns well with the modular nature of the application. This enables us to efficiently develop and maintain the frontend, ensuring consistency and scalability across different parts of the system.

* **TypeScript Support:** Angular is built with TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript provides benefits such as improved code maintainability, better tooling support, and enhanced error detection during development. These features contribute to a more robust and reliable frontend codebase.

* **Dependency Injection and Services:** Angular's built-in dependency injection mechanism simplifies the management of dependencies and promotes the use of services for implementing business logic and data retrieval. This facilitates separation of concerns and enhances code reusability and testability.

* **Comprehensive Ecosystem and Tooling:** Angular offers a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and resources for frontend development, including powerful CLI (Command Line Interface) tools for scaffolding projects, generating code, and optimizing performance. This ecosystem streamlines the development process and provides extensive support for building complex, feature-rich applications like Fish Watch.

* **Strong Community Support and Long-term Stability:** Angular is backed by Google and boasts a large and active community of developers, which ensures ongoing support, frequent updates, and access to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and documentation. This provides confidence in the long-term stability and maintainability of the frontend codebase.

## Consequences
* **Learning Curve:** Angular has a relatively steep learning curve, especially for developers who are new to TypeScript or component-based frameworks. Training and onboarding efforts may be required to familiarize team members with Angular's concepts and best practices.
* **Complexity of Setup:** Setting up an Angular project and configuring the build process can be more involved compared to some other frontend frameworks. However, Angular's CLI tools help streamline this process and provide guidance for project setup and configuration.
* **Performance Considerations:** While Angular offers excellent performance out of the box, improper usage of features like change detection or inefficient component architecture can impact performance. Careful optimization and performance tuning may be necessary to ensure optimal frontend performance for Fish Watch.
