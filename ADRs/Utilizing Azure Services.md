# Utilizing Azure Services for Fish Watch Application Architecture
## Status
ACCEPTED
## Context 
In the development of the Fish Watch application, which aims to provide comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities for fish farms, decisions need to be made regarding the selection of cloud services to support various functionalities such as caching, storage, database management, and IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity. Azure Services offer a wide range of tools and solutions that can address these requirements effectively.
## Decision
We have decided to leverage Azure Services for cache, storage, database management, IoT hub, and IoT gateway functionalities in the Fish Watch application.
## Rationale
* **Scalability and Flexibility:** Azure Services provide scalable and flexible solutions that can accommodate the varying needs of fish farms, from small-scale operations to large commercial enterprises with extensive data requirements. This scalability ensures that the Fish Watch application can grow seamlessly as demand increases.

* **Integration and Compatibility:** Azure Services are designed to work seamlessly together, enabling easy integration between different components of the application. This integration simplifies development efforts and reduces the complexity of managing multiple services and dependencies.

* **Reliability and Security:** Azure Services offer robust security features and compliance certifications, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored and processed by the Fish Watch application. Additionally, Azure's global network of data centers provides high availability and reliability, minimizing the risk of downtime or data loss.

* **IoT Connectivity and Management:** Azure IoT Hub and IoT Gateway services provide comprehensive solutions for connecting, monitoring, and managing IoT devices deployed on fish farms. These services facilitate real-time data ingestion, processing, and analysis, enabling farmers to monitor water quality, fish health, and environmental conditions effectively.

* **Data Storage and Management:** Azure Storage services, including Blob Storage, Table Storage, and Azure SQL Database, offer scalable and cost-effective solutions for storing and managing the large volumes of data generated by fish farms. These services support various data types and access patterns, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

* **Caching for Performance Optimization:** Azure Cache for Redis provides in-memory caching capabilities that can help improve the performance and responsiveness of the Fish Watch application by reducing latency and offloading computational workloads from the backend systems.

## Consequences
* **Vendor Lock-in:** Choosing Azure Services may result in vendor lock-in, limiting the application's portability to other cloud platforms. However, the benefits of leveraging Azure's comprehensive ecosystem and integrated solutions outweigh the potential drawbacks in this context.
* **Cost Considerations:** While Azure Services offer flexible pricing options, careful monitoring and optimization of resource usage are necessary to manage costs effectively, especially as the application scales.
* **Technical Expertise:** Developing and managing a solution based on Azure Services may require specialized technical skills and expertise. Training and upskilling efforts may be necessary to ensure the successful implementation and operation of the Fish Watch application.
