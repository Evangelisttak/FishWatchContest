# Exclusion of Diagram from Final Architecture Decision

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context

During the architectural design phase of the Fish Watch application, various diagrams were considered to illustrate different aspects of the system's structure, behavior, and interactions. However, not all proposed diagrams were included in the final architecture documentation.

## Decision

We have decided to exclude the below mentioned diagrams from the final architecture documentation.
### [Excluded Diagrams](../ADRExcludedDiagrams.md)

## Rationale

* **Relevance:** The excluded diagram was deemed to provide redundant or unnecessary information that did not significantly contribute to the understanding of the system architecture or its key components.
* **Simplicity:** Including too many diagrams, especially those with marginal relevance, could potentially overwhelm readers and detract from the clarity and conciseness of the architecture documentation.
* **Focus:** The decision to exclude certain diagrams allowed us to prioritize the inclusion of diagrams that were deemed essential for conveying critical aspects of the architecture and addressing key design considerations.
* **Maintenance:** By limiting the number of diagrams included in the final documentation, we reduce the burden of maintaining and updating unnecessary or seldom-used diagrams over time.

## Consequences

* **Potential Information Loss:** The exclusion of certain diagrams may result in the omission of specific details or perspectives that could have provided additional insights into the architecture or its components.
* **Communication Challenges:** Stakeholders who may have found value in the excluded diagram may experience challenges in fully understanding certain aspects of the architecture or may require additional clarification from the architecture team.
* **Documentation Flexibility:** While the decision to exclude the diagram was made based on current requirements and priorities, there remains the possibility of revisiting this decision in the future should the need arise to include the diagram in subsequent revisions of the architecture documentation.
