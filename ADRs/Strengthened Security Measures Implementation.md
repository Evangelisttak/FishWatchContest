# Strengthened Security Measures Implementation
## Status
ACCEPTED
## Context 
In response to evolving security threats and the need for continuous improvement in our security posture, we have identified the necessity to enhance our existing security measures.
## Decision
We proposed the following additional security measures:

* ### **Incoming Traffic:**
#### **Azure IoT Hub Entry Point:**
1) Utilize Azure IoT Hub as the entry point for device traffic.
2) Implement built-in security features including:
#### **Device Authentication:**
Devices must authenticate using security tokens or X.509 certificates.
#### **Device-to-Cloud Communication Encryption:**
Encrypt data transmission using TLS/SSL.
* ### **Component Security:**
#### **Managed Kubernetes Service:**
Ensure secure configurations and access controls.
#### **Managed Database Service:**
Implement encryption, access control, and network/firewall policies.
#### **Managed Blob Storage:**
Apply data encryption, access controls, and network/firewall policies.
* ### **Communication Between Various Services:**
#### **Secure Communication Channels:**
Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
Enforce access control using network security policies and firewalls.
* ### **Authentication and Authorization:**
#### **Azure Active Directory (AAD):**
Utilize AAD for authentication.
Follow industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorization.

 

## Consequences
These security measures provide a comprehensive framework for safeguarding our system against various threats including unauthorized access, data interception, and eavesdropping. By implementing these measures, we enhance the overall security posture of our system and ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our data and services.
